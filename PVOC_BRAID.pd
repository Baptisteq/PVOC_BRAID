#X text 663 494 In Some levels \, audio playback is controled by the
movement of the player (to be more accurate the X position in the 2D
scene). According to the speed of the player \, the music will be faster
or slower. I took the same mechanic and change some aspects. As for
the first prototype i preserve the tonality of the song. Also \, when
the player is not moving the music freeze. This is something that the
Phase Vocoder playback system is able to do. When the player achieve
his nominal speed the playback system switch to the nominal playback.

#X text 669 778 With these 3 prototypes I Wanted to show the interactive
and esthetic potential of the Phase Vocoder playback engine by reproducing
the audio/control mechanics of Braid. And to give an "hommage" for
a game I deeply like;
#X text 1191 495 The ring is an object that can be put on the ground.
It creates an area where the time is extremely slow when going near
the center and goes back to normal by the distance. The Phase Vocoder
playback system allows to change the transposition of each sample and
keep the same speed. In this prototype the playback location of the
PVOC is synchronised with the nominal playback's location. So the speed
is the same as the original when the PVOC is engaged \, whereas the
tonality of the sound can be transposed without altering the playback
speed.;
#X text 130 15 In Braid the hero has the ability to rewind the time
and to go back forward \, it is a key element of the gameplay and all
the puzzles are resolved aroud this mechanic. When the hero goes in
"TimeShift" mode \, graphical and audio feedback give the information
to the player that past events can be replayed to change the course
of the game. The Audio feeback in the game are divised in two stems.
Audio varispeed of the music and audio varispeed of the game objects
presents in the scene.;
#X text 671 13 This key element of the gameplay inspire me since I
experimented with Miller's Puckette work called Phase Vocoder (I07.Phase
Vocoder.pd example). Miller Puckette is the maker of Pure Data. The
phase Vocoder is an audio playback system that allows to play an audio
faster or slower and keeping the nominal tonality of the sound and
vice versa \, altering the tonality of the sound and keeping the same
audio lengh. It has a lot of creative potential for sound design aswell
as interactive mechanic in video games.;
#X text 1201 13 Braid is an inspiration aswell as Johnatan Blow's recent
piece "The witness". His games confront the player to question his
environment to solve puzzles and question himself his own approach
to issues and the way he thinks. He creates modern games experiences
with tools that are diverted from their original function \, to serve
gameplay mechanics. For example 3D environement pattern puzzle in The
Witness and variation of the music's playback speed in synch with the
shift of time \, in Braid.;
#X text 144 494 With the combinaison Shift + "Up" and "Down" the player
can go back or forward with some coefficient of speed (*1 *2 *4 *8
and in reverse * -1 *-2...) at * -1 the music and audio objects are
played at nominal speed but in reverse and at * -2 in reverse and twice
faster (so one octave higher). In This prototype I wanted to preserve
this mechanic but to keep aswell the tonality of the song. In this
playback system there are always two playback engine one nominal and
one Phase Vocoder. By entering and exiting Shift mode the system always
crossfade between one and the other. The Xfade section is here to keep
a natural effect of coherence when switching between both. The Phase
Vocoder has a huge impact on the stereo field if already existent in
the original audio file. The PVOC_Stereo_Widht is here to either keep
a coherent stereo field between nominal and PVOC playback \, or to
exagerate the audio stereo field to notify the player he is in the
timeshift mode.;
