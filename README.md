# PVOC_BRAID
I played the video game called Braid (http://braid-game.com/) from the creator of The Witness: Jonathan Blow. I decided to explore the audio mechanics with pure data and the Phase Vocoder playback engine that I already experimented (see https://github.com/Baptisteq/Prototype_pvoc_snapshot_timeline) 

# FAST SETUP:
1. Get pure data 0.47.1: https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data/releases/0.47-1
2. Download the last release: https://github.com/Baptisteq/PVOC_BRAID/releases/tag/V.1.1
2. Launch Patch PVOC_BRAID.pd
3. By default the first module is on you will hear the music. You can start experimenting by pressing the left shift key and the "+" and "-" keys. 
4. You can switch between the three other module by clicking on the Disable/Enable Button

Thank you for trying my patch
